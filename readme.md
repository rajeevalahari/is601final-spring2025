# **Implemented Feature: RBAC Enhancements & Role-Audit Trail**

We introduced an advanced **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system featuring a specialized **Superadmin** role. This robust functionality allows **Superadmins** to securely manage user permissions by elevating or reducing user roles within the application, significantly enhancing administrative oversight.

### **âœ¨ Key Features:**

* **Superadmin Privileges:**
  Only users assigned the new `SUPERADMIN` role can modify the roles of other users, ensuring strict control over sensitive permissions.

* **Comprehensive Audit Logging:**
  Every change in a user's role is meticulously logged in the newly introduced `role_change_audit` table, capturing:

  * User affected by the role change.
  * Superadmin initiating the change.
  * Previous role and updated role.
  * Timestamp of the change.

* **New API Endpoints:**
  Two dedicated endpoints have been added:

  * `PATCH /users/{user_id}/role`: Allows Superadmins to change a user's role.
  * `GET /users/{user_id}/role-history`: Enables Superadmins to view the complete audit history of role changes for a specific user.

* **Database Schema Updates:**

  * Added an `admin_role` column to the existing `users` table to clearly distinguish between standard `ADMIN` and elevated `SUPERADMIN` roles.
  * Created the `role_change_audit` table to store detailed records of every role modification event.

* **Enhanced Security with JWT:**
  JWT tokens now contain an additional `admin_role` field, used by authentication middleware to differentiate between admin levels, ensuring precise enforcement of permissions throughout the application.

* **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
  Extensive unit and integration tests were implemented, specifically covering:

  * Role-changing logic.
  * Audit trail creation.
  * API endpoint functionality and validation.
  * Enforcement of role-based permissions and error handling scenarios.

The combination of these features ensures enhanced security, transparency, and administrative effectiveness, significantly elevating the application's overall integrity and reliability.

# âœ… **Quality Assurance (QA) Issues Closed**

### **QA Issue #1: Role history endpoint crashes on empty result**

* **Problem:** API threw a 500 error when a user had no audit history.
* **Solution:** Implemented graceful handling to return an empty list (`[]`) when no audit records exist.
* **Test:** Confirmed with `test_role_history_empty_returns_200`.

### **QA Issue #2: Unnecessary audit record when roles unchanged**

* **Problem:** Audit logs recorded changes even when roles were identical, cluttering logs.
* **Solution:** Added a conditional check to avoid unnecessary audit log entries if no role change occurred.
* **Test:** Verified via `test_skip_audit_if_role_unchanged`.

### **QA Issue #3: Nonexistent user returns 500 instead of 404**

* **Problem:** Attempting to fetch role history of a nonexistent user resulted in an uncaught internal error.
* **Solution:** Added proper validation checks to return a clear 404 response if the user does not exist.
* **Test:** Validated using `test_role_history_nonexistent_returns_404`.

### **QA Issue #4: Invalid role enum values accepted**

* **Problem:** API allowed invalid enum values (e.g., "GODMODE"), causing unexpected failures.
* **Solution:** Improved request validation by strictly enforcing valid enum values via Pydantic schemas.
* **Test:** Ensured robust validation with `test_change_role_invalid_enum`.

### **QA Issue #5: Case-sensitive email uniqueness**

* **Problem:** Emails with varying case (e.g., "[User@example.com](mailto:User@example.com)" vs "[user@Example.com](mailto:user@Example.com)") were incorrectly treated as unique.
* **Solution:** Normalized email addresses to lowercase for consistent uniqueness validation.
* **Test:** Confirmed fix with `test_email_uniqueness_case_insensitive`.

# ðŸ§ª **Comprehensive Testing Added**

To ensure robust functionality and stability, we have significantly expanded our test suite, adding **10 critical tests**:

1. `test_superadmin_can_change_role_and_audit`: Ensures Superadmins can change roles with proper auditing.
2. `test_role_history_endpoint_for_superadmin`: Checks successful retrieval of audit logs.
3. `test_change_role_nonexistent_user_returns_404`: Confirms correct handling of nonexistent users.
4. `test_change_role_creates_audit_entry`: Validates audit log creation upon role changes.
5. `test_change_role_nonexistent_user_returns_none`: Tests graceful handling in the service layer when user not found.
6. `test_user_role_assignment_correctness`: Ensures correct role assignment at user creation.
7. `test_has_role_method`: Validates the accuracy of the `has_role()` method on user objects.
8. `test_user_repr_includes_admin_role`: Checks accurate representation (`__repr__`) of user roles.
9. `test_role_change_noop_idempotent_behavior`: Ensures no unnecessary database writes occur if roles are unchanged.
10. `test_role_change_api_validation`: Confirms API request validation rejects invalid role enumerations effectively.

These tests collectively ensure that our RBAC implementation meets quality standards and prevents regressions.
